    <h1>Voilà le règlement de l'événement :</h1>
    <p>
        All design elements, code, hardware builds, etc. for your project must be created during the event. Third party tools and frameworks are allowed as well as your normal tooling (Gulp, Yeoman, Composer, NPM, Bower, etc.).
 
While you may not begin coding in advance, you can plan and discuss with your team in advance.

Teams must be comprised of 5 people maximum.

Only ten of the competing teams will present their projects in the final round of judging at the end of the event.

You must treat all team members, competitors, judges, coaches, volunteers, etc... with respect.

Teams can work on ideas that have already been done. Hacks do not have to be “innovative”. If somebody wants to work on a common idea they should be allowed to do so and should be judged on the quality of their hack.

Teams can use libraries, frameworks, or open-source code in their projects. Working on a project before the event and open-sourcing it for the sole purpose of using the code during the event is against the spirit of the rules and is not allowed.

Teams must stop hacking once the time is up. However, teams are allowed to debug and make small fixes to their programs after time is up.

There is no age restriction.

No illicit products allowed.

If someone doesn't respect the rules the team will be disqualified from the event.
